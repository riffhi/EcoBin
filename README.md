2. **Collection Optimization:**
   - Collaborates with municipalities, NGOs, etc. for waste collection.
3. **Citizen Engagement:**
   - Reporting system to upload images and pinpoint waste locations on a map.
   - Gamified leaderboards and reward systems to encourage active participation.
   - Blogs and news updates to keep users informed on sustainability practices and achievements.
